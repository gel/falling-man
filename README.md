## Context

Yearly project for technion computer graphics course (built in 2010). 

I've built a full end-to-end platformer game which is using shaders and a physics engine (chosen Unity).

The game randomizes maps by levels and includes bunch of settings to set the difficulty and sensitivity of the gameplay.

The player's target is to finish and advance in levels. The player must stay alive by avoiding the falling ceiling, keep track of time and avoid obstacles (health-based).
There are added features such as dynamic capabilities (enabling jump after X points) and different platform types (different enemies, bonuses - time + health, finish markers).
